== Amended elements of the PubID

=== General

This section provides a set of elements that provides additional information
compared with the list provided in <<PUBID>>.

Notably, it provides data elements their corresponding rendering text for
"full form", "abbreviated form" and "machine-readable" formats.

=== Stage

The stage code element only applies to non-final publications.

In most series, documents are only released as final publications, and therefore
their PubIDs will not contain a stage code.

Only some series support stage codes, e.g. SP 800 and SP 1800.

| Name | Value

| Initial Public Draft | IPD
| Second Public Draft (to the Nth Public Draft) | 2PD (... nPD)
| Final Public Draft | FPD
| Work-in-Progress Draft | WD

|===

=== Report number

The contents and pattern of the report number are dependent on the series.

Possible values:

* `{sequence number}`
* `{subseries}-{sequence number}`
* `{sequence number}-{volume}`
* `{sequence number}-{edition}`
* `{subseries}-{sequence number}-{edition}`
* etc.

A "Part" can also be indicated by an appended alphabetic character to the end.

All part types allow a suffix number.

=== Translation

An ISO 639-2 3-letter code that represents a translated document from English.

If a document is translated from English, suffix the document with a 3-letter
ISO 639-2 code within parentheses.

Raw values seen in legacy DOIs include:

NOTE: Only these 4 languages were seen in the full NIST Tech Pubs database.

=== Update

==== General

When a document is updated with an errata, the original edition may be reissued
to include the errata.

These documents will display the text "includes updates as of...".

In this case the document identifier will include the element "Update".

|===

==== Update number

A sequential integer numbering of the update counting from the original document.

The first update is numbered 1, and so forth.

==== Update year

The year last updated, shown as a suffix to the identifier.
